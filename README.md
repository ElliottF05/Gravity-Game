# Gravity-Game
Control a spaceship to get to where you need to be! This is my first game, made using pygame and to improve my skills.

## Current Status: In progress
At mininum viable product for physics, but not for "game" aspects

## Goals
- Use OOP
- Create basic 2d graphics using sprites
- Decently good looking art style
- Good user controls
- Mildly fun concept
- Sound effects?
- Some procedurally generated levels

## Next Steps
1. Add buttons for better UX
3. Create "game" aspects were player must reach desired orbit
4. Add sprites and make it good looking
5. Finalize

## Potential Changes
- Look up best practices for sharing variables across modules and implement this!!!
