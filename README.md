# Gravity-Game
Control a spaceship to get to where you need to be! This is my first game, made using pygame and to improve my skills.

## Current Status: In progress
Not currently near minimum viable product

## Goals
- Use OOP
- Create basic 2d graphics using sprites
- Decently good looking art style
- Good user controls
- Mildly fun concept
- Sound effects?
- Some procedurally generated levels

## Next Steps
3. Add realtime maneuvers where key is held instead of pressing a key for large jarring increments
6. Add buttons for better UX
7. Create "game" aspects were player must reach desired orbit
2. Add sprites and make it good looking
3. Finalize

## Potential Changes
- Maybe make trail its own class/object
- Look up best practices for sharing variables across modules and implement this!!!
