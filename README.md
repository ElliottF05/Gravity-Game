# Gravity-Game
Control a spaceship to get to where you need to be! This is my first game, made using pygame and to improve my skills.

## Current Status: In progress
Not currently near minimum viable product

## Goals
- Use OOP
- Create basic 2d graphics using sprites
- Decently good looking art style
- Good user controls
- Mildly fun concept
- Sound effects?
- Some procedurally generated levels

## Next Steps
1. Improve this to-do list
2. Add basic camera controls
   1. Focus modes (on spaceship, on center of mass, containing all bodies)
3. Add basic player interaction
   1. Maneuver controls! Also must create trail showing future path for a given maneuver
4. Add sprites and make it good looking
5. Finalize

## Potential Changes
- Maybe make trail its own class/object
