# Gravity-Game
Control a spaceship to get to where you want to be! This is my first game, made using pygame and to improve my skills.

## Current Status: In progress
At minimum viable product

## Personal Note / Next Steps
I'm currently very happy with how the physics of the game has turned out and how I've overcome the challenges I've faced.
This is also the part the interests me the most. That being said, I'm not as interested/passionate about adding sprites, sound effects, a nice UI, etc.
For now, I want to finalize some physics changes, and potentially revisit this later when I have a better understanding of sprites and graphics (so it's not so daunting requiring an entire new learning process).

That being said, here are my next steps:

1. Change time step system to work better with large, slow-moving systems.
2. Add camera settings focusing on each body
3. Add camera panning
2. Revisit at a later date after learning best practices for sprites. I also still want to look up best practices for using moduels and classes as I feel my way is convoluted.

## Goals
- Use OOP
- Create basic 2d graphics using sprites
- Decently good looking art style
- Good user controls
- Mildly fun concept
- Sound effects?
- Some procedurally generated levels


## Potential Changes
- Look up best practices for sharing variables across modules and implement this!!!
