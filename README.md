# Gravity-Game
Control a spaceship to get to where you need to be! This is my first game, made using pygame and to improve my skills.

## Current Status: In progress
Not currently near minimum viable product

## Goals
- Use OOP
- Create basic 2d graphics using sprites
- Decently good looking art style
- Good user controls
- Mildly fun concept
- Sound effects?
- Some procedurally generated levels

## Next Steps
1. Make custom vector class to replace using tuples.
   1. Implement + and * operator functionality
2. Add functionality for radial in and radial out maneuvers
3. Add buttons for better UX
2. Add sprites and make it good looking
3. Finalize

## Potential Changes
- Maybe make trail its own class/object
- Look up best practices for sharing variables across modules and implement this!!!
